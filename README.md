This is the repository for a talk on an investigation into systemic bias in Canada's federal prison risk assessments. The slides can be found here: https://tomcardoso.github.io/uottawa-bias-2021/

This talk was originally given to a Sentencing and Corrections class at the Univeristy of Ottawa on October 21, 2021. Here’s a brief description:

> In late October, The Globe and Mail published Bias Behind Bars, a front-page investigation into systemic racism in federal prisons using a database of more than 50,000 people obtained via a freedom of information request. Risk assessments, used widely within the prison system, are meant to be an impartial guide of who can be rehabilitated and how soon, but racialized people routinely get the worst possible scores. These assessments are steeped in decades of research – but, as The Globe found, they’re also fundamentally, powerfully biased against Indigenous and Black prisoners, placing them in higher security classifications and assigning them worse odds of successfully re-entering society. Since Bias Behind Bars was published, a proposed class-action lawsuit has been launched on behalf of tens of thousands of prisoners, and the House of Commons public safety committee has vowed to study the issue.
